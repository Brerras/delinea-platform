# Prepare Oauth Authentication

## OAuth Client Credentials Flow in Intune 

This connector utilizes an OAuth 2.0 application in Intune using the Client Credentials grant type. This flow is typically used for server-to-server API requests where the application itself needs to authenticate and interact with Intune  APIs.
More information can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/?view=graph-rest-1.0). 
â€‹
### Prerequisites

- Access to a Intune instance with administrative privileges.
- Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 and Intune administration.

## Create an OAuth Application Registry

- Create an OAuth application registry using the following method:
  - Create an endpoint for external clients that want to access your instance. This creates an OAuth client application record and generates a client ID and client secret that the client needs to access the restricted resources on the instance.
  - Grant Graph API Application Permissions with at least:
    - DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All
    - DeviceManagementRBAC.Read.All
    - Group.Read.All
    - Group.GroupMember.Read.All
  - And Delegated API Permissions
    - User.Read
    - User.Read.All
