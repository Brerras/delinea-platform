## Prepare Oauth Authentication

## OAuth Client Credentials Flow in ServiceNow

This connector utilizes an OAuth 2.0 application in ServiceNow using the client credentials grant type. This flow is typically used for server-to-server API requests where the application itself needs to authenticate and interact with ServiceNow APIs.

### Prerequisites

- Access to a ServiceNow instance with administrative privileges.
Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 and ServiceNow administration.

## Create an OAuth Application Registry

- Create an OAuth application registry using the following method:
  - Create an endpoint for external clients that want to access your instance. This creates an OAuth client application record and generates a client ID and client secret that the client needs to access the restricted resources on the instance

- Document the following values as they will be needed in the upcoming sections
  - clientId, clientSecret, username, and password
  . The suername and password should be the credential that has the permisions to Discover Users and Change their Passwords
