Follow the Steps below to complete the base setup for the Connector

## Prepare Oauth Authentication

## OAuth Client Credentials Flow in Tableau
<!--For development testing, a Personal Access Token is being used instead of the JWToken. -->
This connector utilizes an OAuth 2.0 application in Tableau using the JWT Bearer grant type. This flow is typically used for server-to-server API requests where the application itself needs to authenticate and interact with Tableau APIs.
More information can be found [here](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_authentication.htm). 
â€‹
### Prerequisites

- Access to a Tableau instance with administrative privileges.
- Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 and Tableau administration.

## Create an OAuth Application Registry
<!--For development testing, a Personal Access Token is being used and this method below was not tested -->
- Create an OAuth application registry using the following method:
  - Create an endpoint for external clients that want to access your instance. This creates an OAuth client application record and generates a client ID and client secret that the client needs to access the restricted resources on the instance.

- Document the following values as they will be needed in the upcoming sections
  - clientId, clientSecret.
