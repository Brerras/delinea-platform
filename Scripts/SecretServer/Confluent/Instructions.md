# Prepare Oauth Authentication

  

## OAuth Client Credentials Flow in Confluent

  

This connector utilizes an OAuth 2.0 application in Confluent using the Client Credentials grant type. This flow is typically used for server-to-server API requests where the application itself needs to authenticate and interact with Confluent APIs.
â€‹

### Prerequisites

  

- Access to a Confluent instance with administrative privileges.

- Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 and Confluent administration.

  

## Create an OAuth Application Registry

  

- Create an OAuth application registry using the following method:

- Create an endpoint for external clients that want to access your instance. This creates an OAuth client application record and generates a client ID and client secret that the client needs to access the restricted resources on the instance.

  

- Document the following values as they will be needed in the upcoming sections

- APIKey
- APISecret
