 # AWS Connector Base Instructions

This connector provides the following functions  

- Discovery of Local Accounts
- Remote Password Changing users
- Heartbeats to verify that user credentials are still valid

Follow the Steps below to complete the base setup for the Connector

This connector utilizes a Service Account along with its Access Key and Secret. This flow is typically used for server-to-server API requests where the application itself needs to authenticate and interact with AWS APIs.
