# Github Connector base configuration

  

This connector provides the following functions

  

- Discovery of Github User Accounts in a given Organization

  

## Not currently available

- Remote Password Changing Github users

Follow the Steps below to complete the base setup for the Connector

  

# Prepare User Token Authentication

  

## OAuth User Token Flow in Github

  

This connector utilizes a user token that is granted at the organization level. This flow is typically used for Service-to-server API requests where the service itself needs to authenticate and interact with Github APIs.

### Prerequisites

  

- Login to a Github instance with administrative privileges (i.e. a user who has a RO systems administrator role).

- User token generated from Github

- Basic understanding of Personal Access Token authentication and Github administration.

  

## Create a Personal Access Token

  

- Create a personal access for for programmatic Discovery found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

  

*** For more information click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization#restricting-access-by-personal-access-tokens-classic).

  

- Document the following values as they will be needed in the upcoming sections

- Github personal access token

- Go to Settings > Developer Settings > Tokens (classic) > Generate token

- Make sure the scopes selected are:

- read:user

- read:organization

- Ensure that the token is configured for SAML or an error will appear when using the token:

- {"message":"Resource protected by organization SAML enforcement. You must grant your Personal Access token access to this organization.}
