# Docusign eSignature Connector Overview

This connector provides the following functions:  

- Discovery of Docusign eSignature User Accounts in a given Site

## Not currently available in Docusign eSignature Cloud

- Remote Password Changing Docusign eSignature users
- Heartbeats to verify that user credentials are still valid


> [!NOTE]
> Due to deprecations to legacy authentication methods, basic user password authentication is no longer supported. We are unable to validate user passwords via heartbeat methods through impersonation and have created placeholders. If this becomes available in the future. For additional information, please refer to [Docusign Support FAQs](https://support.docusign.com/s/articles/DocuSign-Developer-FAQs-eSignature-API?language=en_US).

Follow the Steps below to complete the base setup for the Connector

# Prepare Oauth Authentication

## OAuth Client Credentials Flow in Docusign eSignature

This connector utilizes an OAuth 2.0 application in Docusign using the JWT Bearer grant type. This flow is typically used for server-to-server API requests where the application itself needs to authenticate and interact with Docusign APIs.
More information can be found [here](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/auth/). 
â€‹
### Prerequisites

- Access to a Docusign eSignature instance with administrative privileges.
- Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 and Docusign administration.

## Create an OAuth Application Registry

- Create an OAuth application registry using the following method:
  - Create an endpoint for external clients that want to access your instance. This creates an OAuth client application record and generates a client ID and integration key that the client needs to access the restricted resources on the instance.

*** For more information and directions, click [here](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/jwt-get-token/).

- Document the following values as they will be needed in the upcoming sections
  - clientId/integration key, subject user id, audience uri, PEM private key, tenant account id
> [!NOTE]
> Field descriptions and details can be found at [Docusign JWT structure and properties](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/jwt-get-token/#see-details-jwt-structure-and-properties).
